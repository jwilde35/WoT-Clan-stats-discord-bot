Self explanitory, but you should install this on a computer that is running all the time.
There are services out there that will host the bot in case you can't.
https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/5guuiz/how_to_host_a_discord_bot_for_free/

Installation Instructions:

1. unzip the bot
2. install nodejs https://nodejs.org/en/download/
3. run install.bat
4. you need to create two or three voice channels, depending on your needs
	one to display your clan member count, 
	one to display your discord member count,
	and optionally one to display your unverified users count
5. next, go to http://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me
	a. press new application
	b. give the bot a name
	c. press save changes
	d. on the left, click bot, then click add bot
	e. your token is in this menu, put it in the config.js
6. fill in the config file the rest of the way (config.js)
7. finally, run start.bat, you should be good to go!
